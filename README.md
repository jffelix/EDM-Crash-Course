# EDM Crash Course

Hello and welcome to my class! For those of you who don't know, EDM is an acronym from "Electronic Dance Music". This form of music has been around as far as the late 70's. Over the years, EDM has expanded to multiple genres and sub-genres, most of which may be difficult to tell apart if you aren't really familiar with it. 

No fear! I am here to help with this simple application that has already sorted it out for you in my mini-library of electronic music. After clicking begin, simply choose a genre from the dropdown menu and click the play button for a song sample that I believe best represents the selected genre. Enjoy!

## How to run the application

- Fork this repo and git clone the repo into your personal computer
- Open VS Code with your git cloned file.
- Open two split Terminals inside your VS Code.
- Run "npm start" and "npm run build" in seperate Terminals
- Open a Google Chrome browser and use localhost:4001
